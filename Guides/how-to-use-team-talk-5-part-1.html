    <h1>How to use Team Talk 5</h1>
    <p>By Harper</p>

    <h2>How to use Team Talk?</h2>
    <p>Team Talk is a client meant for comprehensive chats and conversations. It is used in a variety of ways within the blind community.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Team Talk is made by bearware.dk and is in no way affiliated with Harper and Jakob's projects. This is only a user guide. For the official documentation, please visit the <a href="https://bearware.dk/?page_id=327">Team Talk documentation</a>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Downloading the Client</h2>
    <p>To download the client, visit <a href="https://bearware.dk/?page_id=353">here</a> and select your version. The .exe file is for Windows, while iOS and Android have App Store or Google Play links. Information regarding Linux installation will be updated as it becomes available.</p>

    <h2>Windows</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Download the latest release of the client as a .exe file. Select the file named <strong>teamtalk5.exe</strong>; this is the most up-to-date version.</li>
        <li>Open the setup file once the download completes.</li>
        <li>Follow the setup prompts. If you do not plan to host a server, you only need the <strong>Client</strong> component. If you do plan to host a server (requires port forwarding), download the <strong>Client and Server</strong> package.</li>
        <li>After installation, open the client. It will ask to use your computer's default language; click "Yes" unless you prefer another.</li>
        <li>It will ask to add a firewall exception; use your discretion here. Finally, it will ask to enable better support for <strong>screen readers</strong>—it is highly recommended to select "Yes."</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Adding a Server</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Press <strong>F2</strong> (or Fn+F2) to bring up the "Connect to a Server" dialog.</li>
        <li>Tab over to <strong>Add New Server</strong>.</li>
        <li>Enter the server details: IP address, ports, username, password, and encryption settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Admin Controls</h2>
    <h3>Windows</h3>
    <p>On Windows, administrators have extensive control over the server:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Accounts:</strong> Press <code>Ctrl+Shift+L</code> to access the account menu to add, delete, or edit user rights.</li>
        <li><strong>Kick Users:</strong> Use <code>Ctrl+K</code> to kick from a channel or <code>Ctrl+Shift+K</code> to kick from the server.</li>
        <li><strong>Ban Users:</strong> Press <code>Ctrl+Shift+B</code> to ban a user from the server.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>iOS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Search for "TeamTalk" on the App Store to download.</li>
        <li>Open the app and tap <strong>Add New Server Entry</strong> at the top of the screen.</li>
        <li>Enter the address and port details, then click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>iOS offers slightly fewer controls than Windows, but is still very reliable:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Kick Users:</strong> Select the user in the channel and tap "Kick User."</li>
        <li><strong>Ban Users:</strong> Select the user and tap "Ban User" to remove them from the server.</li>
    </ul>
